## Research Design

This study employs a **Developmental Research Design** to create and evaluate the School Forum System for Grades 11 and 12 students. This design is appropriate because prior research establishes that effective digital communication platforms significantly predict student engagement and academic performance (Johnson et al., 2023) and that well-integrated forum systems can enhance peer learning and collaborative outcomes (Martinez & Chen, 2022). The development process follows four main phases: (1) **Analysis**, which involves identifying user needs and system requirements based on the literature and the need for secure educational communication; (2) **Design**, where system architecture, interface layouts, and security structures are planned according to Social Learning Theory and Community of Practice principles; (3) **Development**, where the core modules—authentication system, forum discussions, role-based access control, and gamification features—are constructed using an iterative approach; and (4) **Testing**, which includes functional, security, and user evaluation to ensure that the system meets the intended educational objectives. Through this structured developmental process, the study aims to produce a unified and reliable digital platform that supports student communication, academic collaboration, and community building within a secure educational environment.
